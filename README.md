# side_projects
Just some one-file applications for personal projects

Currently I published the following files in thi repository.

# 1 Codeforces / Competitive Programming Template in CPP

A solidly structured template with fast cin/cout and a few extra-features like quick array/vector display for debugging and a binEx function.

# 2 Rankfinder for the video game LoL using webscraping with Python

The rankfinder.py file allows access to a player's rank and elo by using data from op.gg.
